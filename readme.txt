#####   RPG Template for Ruby/Gosu   #####

Alpha version, so dont expect too much =)

This is a template to make you own jRPG easily!
You dont need to worry about the basic things like maps engine, menus, etc
All you need is edit the options, design your own maps, heros, npc, monster, items, etc and click play!

All the code is structured in the best way i can to give more flexibility to make edits in the code.

Some features for now are:

-Pixel movement
-Collisions (hero with npcs and objects, and npcs with objects and the hero)
-Cool menu (H)
-Scenes based system to make your own menus
-Windows structured to make your own windows easily
-Initial settings to make things easier
-etc

-- Controls (for now):

---- Return (Enter): Choose options in the menus.
---- Arrows: Move the hero in the map and move the index in the menus.
---- Escape: Go back to the map from the menu, go back from the menu status to the options.


All improves/fixes/adviced/etc are welcome!
